# IveskArchiver
This script downloads Ä®vesk archive PDF files for your favorite companies and saves them in the folder specified as `outputpath`.

The following is the tree of folders the files will be placed in: 
```
<outputpath>/<company>/YYYY-MM/<Pirkima|Pardavimai>/<document date> <document number> <client name>.pdf
```

* `company` - company name that accountant is working on (a favorite marked company in Ivesk.lt).
* `YYYY-MM` - year and month taken from document's date.

Script works like this. Downloads everything there is new in Ivesk.lt and marks last file date. It will remember where it left off and running the script again will download next batch of files, if they are available. If not, then it will do nothing.
The file, where the next page key is stored, is also saved in `<outputpath>`. It should not be deleted. If it is deleted, the script will download all the files you have already downloaded again.

In case of failure, the script will not lose progress and resume where it left off the next time it is run.
